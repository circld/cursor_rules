# Core Coding Principles

## Data-First Design
- Prefer data to calculations or actions
- Pass data to functions rather than defining it in function bodies
- Functions should be passed data rather than accessing global/external state

## Pure Functions Priority
- Prefer calculations (pure functions) to actions (impure functions)
- Pure functions always produce the same output for the same input
- Avoid side effects like disk IO, network IO, or logging in calculations

## Action Placement
- Place actions at the edge of the application (bottom of call stack)
- Separate program description from program execution
- Determine what the program should do before executing
