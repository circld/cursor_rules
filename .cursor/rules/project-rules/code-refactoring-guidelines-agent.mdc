# Code Refactoring Guidelines

## Separation of Concerns
When refactoring, organize code into three categories:

### Data Layer
- Plain objects, arrays, primitives
- No behavior, only structure
- Immutable when possible

### Calculation Layer  
- Pure functions that transform data
- No side effects or external dependencies
- Predictable and testable

### Action Layer
- Functions that perform effects (IO, logging, etc.)
- Should be pushed to application edges
- Call calculations but don't contain business logic

## Refactoring Process
1. Identify mixed concerns in existing code
2. Extract pure calculations first
3. Isolate data structures
4. Push actions to boundaries
